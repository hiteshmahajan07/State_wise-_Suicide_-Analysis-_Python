# State-wise Suicide Analysis in India (Python)
🔍 Project Overview

This project performs an exploratory data analysis of suicide statistics across Indian States and Union Territories using Python.
The objective is to understand state-wise trends, compare male and female suicide cases, and identify the most affected regions through data cleaning, sorting, and visualization.

📁 Dataset

* Suicide Statistics in Indian States.csv
* The dataset contains:
* State/UT name
* Male suicide count
* Female suicide count
* Total suicides
* Suicide categories

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas – Data loading, cleaning, and analysis
* Matplotlib – Data visualization

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Handled missing values by replacing null female suicide counts with 0
* Converted male suicide data to numeric format for accurate analysis
* Selected only required columns for focused analysis

📊 Analysis Performed

* Identified top 5 states/UTs based on:
* Male suicide cases
* Female suicide cases
* Total suicide cases
* Compared gender-wise suicide distribution
* Sorted states in descending order to highlight highly affected regions

📈 Visualizations

* The project includes bar charts for:
* Male suicides by State/UT
* Female suicides by State/UT
* Total suicides by State/UT
* These visualizations help in quickly identifying trends and regional differences.

🔎 Key Insights

* Male suicide cases are significantly higher than female cases in most states
* A small number of states contribute to a large portion of total suicides
* Visualization makes regional patterns easy to understand and compare



🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Python can be used for real-world social data analysis, helping uncover meaningful insights from raw data. It highlights the importance of data-driven approaches in understanding critical social issues.
